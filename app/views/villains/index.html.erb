        <p>
          The dark samurai, Lord Matz, is always loyal to the Ruby he forged with his own hands. He is extremely powerful, as smiling as powerful, followed and admired by the entire community. He is originally from the mystical Japan, travelling every place the Ruby has conquered; some even say he treats code as an essay!

        BooBoo spends most of his day attempting to sneak up on innocent Italian plumbers, and generally causing trouble. Any code that BooBoo writes is suspect. In fact, I'm not sure BooBoo can even type properly on a keyboard.
