        <h3>The Hidden "Matz" Samurai</h3>
        <p>
          The dark samurai, Lord Matz, is always loyal to the Ruby he forged with his own hands. He is extremely powerful, as smiling as powerful, followed and admired by the entire community. He is originally from the mystical Japan, travelling every place the Ruby has conquered; some even say he treats code as an essay!

        <h3>Dr. Tenderlove</h3>
        <p>
        Rumored to be a top technical secret agent for an unknown government bent on global destruction, Dr. Tenderlove serves as a top advisor for multiple Ruby projects. His secret goal is to sereptitiously <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/">improve the performance of code</a> across a wide range of areas, all while covering his tracks by distracting us with cat pictures and funny puns.

        Tired of getting NoMethodErrors when you call a method on nil? Is it just too hard to figure out what's really wrong? With nil_roulette, those problems are a thing of the past! nil_roulette will fairly choose a recipient for an unknown method call and just pass the buck. Who needs to know?
