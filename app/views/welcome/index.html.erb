  <h1>Who are the Ruby Villains?</h1>
  <p>The Ruby Villain Award is a tongue-in-cheek, heartfelt award
  <br />
  given to those who create amazing bugs, atrocious hacks, and astounding disasters.
  <br />
  <br />
  It is for the people who have changed our way of looking at code, who've inspired us,
  <br />
  and who've made us stop and catch our breath at the audacity of their efforts.</p>

        <p>
          The dark samurai, Lord Matz, is always loyal to the Ruby he forged with his own hands. He is extremely powerful, as smiling as powerful, followed and admired by the entire community. He is originally from the mystical Japan, travelling every place the Ruby has conquered; some even say he treats code as an essay!

His secret goal is to sereptitiously improve the performance of code across a wide range of areas, all while covering his tracks by distracting us with cat pictures and funny puns.
